# BME3053C FinalProject

All the necessary components for running MATA image classification are included in the /program/ folder, aside from the deep learning and image processing toolboxes that are MATLAB apps.

To run this program, simply download the repository and open the /program/ folder in MATLAB as the current directory. Image files used will need to be in the same directory, in other words removed from any folders, as mammoMATA.m. They are in a folder called sample_images.
Run the mammoMATA.m script and follow the prompt to classify and view possible calcifications and tumor areas.
