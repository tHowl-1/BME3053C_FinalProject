# BME3053C FinalProject

All the necessary components for running MATA image classification are included in the /program/ folder, aside from the deep learning and image processing toolboxes that are matlab apps.

To run this program, simply download the repository and open the /program/ folder in matlab as the current directory. 
Run the mammoMATA.m script and follow the prompt to classify and view possible calcifications and tumor areas.
Files used will need to be in the same directory, as in removed from any folders, as mammoMATA.m
